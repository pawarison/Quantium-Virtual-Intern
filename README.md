We will be examining the performance in trial vs control stores to provide a recommendation for each location based on our insight.

Select control stores – explore the data and define metrics for control store selection – "What would make them a control store?" Visualize the drivers to see suitability.

Assessment of the trial – get insights of each of the stores. Compare each trial store with ontrol store to get its overall performance. We want to know if the trial stores were successful or not.

Collate findings – summarise findings for each store and provide recommendations to share with client outlining the impact on sales during trial period.
